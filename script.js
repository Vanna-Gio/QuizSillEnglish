It's a good feeling! <br>Actually, when I'm practicing, I can genuinely say, 'I feel confident when I speak English.'<br> It's getting easier. And it's not just about English; I feel like I'm learning new things every day, no matter what.<br> Honestly, I think I'm becoming more confident over time. It's a gradual process, but I can feel it. And with that confidence, I really do feel like I can achieve my goals, big or small. <br>I've noticed I feel confident sharing my ideas now, even if they're not perfect. That's a big step for me. And the best part? I am not afraid to make mistakes. I mean, mistakes are how you learn, right? <br>I'm really confident in my ability to learn anything I put my mind to. And when new things come up, I think, 'Yeah, I can handle new challenges.' I'm getting better at just trusting my own judgment. That's important. <br>What really helps is that practicing helps me feel more confident. Every little bit makes a difference. And I'm trying to remember to celebrate my small successes – like when I understand something new or speak clearly. <br>I'm trying to really learn from my experiences, good or bad. And instead of dwelling on what's hard, I'm focusing on my strengths. That makes me feel powerful. Most importantly, I keep trying to encourage myself to try new things. You just never know what you can do until you try!",

                        sentence: `Why do you want to study English?
                        Oh, that's a great question! Well, there are a few main reasons, actually.

                        First off, I really want to improve my career opportunities. English is such a global language, and knowing it well just opens up so many more doors, especially in many industries today. I feel like it's a really important skill for getting ahead.

                        Then there's the travel aspect. I absolutely love the idea of being able to travel more confidently. Imagine going to a new country and being able to communicate easily with people, ask for directions, order food – it would make the whole experience so much richer and less stressful. I really want to be able to explore the world and connect with people from different backgrounds.

                        And, of course, a big part of it is simply for personal growth. Learning English is a huge challenge, but it's also incredibly rewarding. It helps me to think in new ways, and it gives me access to so many more books, movies, and online resources that are in English. It just feels like it's expanding my world, you know?

                        So, yeah, for my career, for travel, and for just growing as a person, those are my main motivations for studying English.
                     
                        `
                       
                    },
                    {
                        sentence: `communication skills
                        You know, I think communication skills are incredibly important in life, really. It's not just about speaking a language, but how we speak and how we listen.

                        For me, good communication helps a lot with building stronger relationships. Whether it's with friends, family, or colleagues, when you can express yourself clearly and understand others, it just makes everything smoother. You feel more connected, right?

                        Also, I've noticed it's super helpful for solving problems. If you can talk openly about an issue and really listen to different ideas, it's much easier to find a solution that works for everyone. Bad communication can cause so many misunderstandings!

                        And in the workplace, it's absolutely essential. Being able to explain your ideas clearly or give good instructions is key. It helps avoid mistakes and makes teamwork much better. People can understand their roles and what needs to be done.

                        I think a big part of good communication is listening actively. It's not just waiting for your turn to speak, but really paying attention to what the other person is saying, and even their body language. That way, you truly understand their message.

                        So, for me, improving my communication skills, especially in English, is about being more effective in my daily life, having better relationships, and being more successful in whatever I do. It's a skill everyone needs, I believe.

                    {
                        sentence: `My Hobbies and Free Time
                        Oh, that's a good question! Well, like most people, I have a few things I really enjoy doing when I'm not busy.
                        First off, I absolutely love reading. I try to make time for it every day, even if it's just for 20 minutes. I mostly enjoy fiction novels because they let me escape into different worlds and stories. It's my way of relaxing and learning new vocabulary at the same time, actually!

                        Besides reading, I've really gotten into taking walks, especially in the evenings. It's a simple activity, but it helps me clear my head and just enjoy being outside. Sometimes I listen to podcasts while I walk, which is a nice way to learn something new or just relax.

                        And, of course, because I'm studying English, a lot of my 'free time' is actually spent on that! I mean, I don't see it as work. I love watching English movies or TV shows without subtitles when I can. It's a fun way to practice my listening. I also enjoy listening to English music and trying to understand the lyrics.

                        So, yeah, reading, walking, and immersing myself in English media – those are pretty much my go-to hobbies and how I spend my free time. They help me relax and also keep me learning, which is perfect!
                        
                        `
                    },
                         
                    {
                        sentence: `How can I improve my English speaking? <br>
                       That's a really important question for me right now, actually. I'm always thinking about how I can improve my English speaking. Since I'm at an A2 level and want to reach B1, I know I need to be strategic.
                        <br>
                        One of the main things I focus on is speaking as much as possible. Even if it's just to myself, or repeating sentences like we're doing now, any speaking practice helps. I try not to be afraid of making mistakes, because that's how you learn, right?
                        <br>
                        Another big one for me is listening a lot. I try to listen to English podcasts, watch TV shows, and even listen to music. The more I hear native speakers, the better I understand the rhythm and pronunciation. I try to mimic their pronunciation when I hear new words or phrases.
                        <br>
                        I also think learning new vocabulary in context is really useful. Instead of just memorizing single words, I try to learn phrases or sentences. That way, I know how to use them naturally in a conversation.
                        <br>
                        And, of course, shadowing is a technique I use a lot. It's really helping me to get the intonation and speed right. I try to record myself sometimes, too, which helps me hear what I need to improve.
                        <br>
                        Finally, I believe consistency is key. Even if it's just a little bit every day, showing up and practicing regularly makes a huge difference. I try to make English a part of my daily routine.
                        <br>
                        So, to sum it up, it's about speaking, listening, learning vocabulary in phrases, using techniques like shadowing, and being consistent every single day.
